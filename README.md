## Project Goals
1. prediction of prevelence of landslide in landslide prone areas using image analysis of satellite images
2. using the analysis in addition with the local soil and weather data to accurately predict the occurance of landslide
3. on site analysis of soil for further risk acessment 
4. using twilio for communication to the affected group by landlides.



## Regarding Soil

* types of soil and it's effect on causation of landslides
    Relations Between Soil Development and Landslides
    Arnaud J.A.M. Temme
    Although landslides can occur in practically all soil types, maps of soil types and soil properties are often and successfully used as copredictors in statistically based landslide susceptibility modeling.

*   Classification of soil by fao base on the properties of soil
    https://www.fao.org/3/i3794en/I3794en.pdf

*   Numerically represent the data obtained from the image classification of satellite imagary
    higher value for soil types with higher probability of landslides


The output of the project is as follows, for the given input
